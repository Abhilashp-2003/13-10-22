	<p class="kiara"><strong>kiaraadvani</strong><br>
			
			Early work (2014–2019)Advani promoting M.S. Dhoni:The Untold Story in 2016
Advani began her acting career with the Hindi ensemble comedy film Fugly (2014).[10] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, "Kiara Advani catches you completely unaware" and has the "combination of looks and talent".[11] Mehul S Thakkar of Deccan Chronicle found her "very striking" and said that she "shows a lot of promise".[12] Fugly underperformed at the box office.[13][14] Two years later, Advani appeared in the sports drama M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016), a biopic of cricketer MS Dhoni who served as the former captain of Indian cricket team.[15] She had a supporting role opposite Sushant Singh Rajput (who essayed Dhoni), as the real-life character of his wife, hotel manager Sakshi Rawat. M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was a major commercial success with global revenues of over ₹216 crore (US$27 million).[16][17]

Advani then starred in Abbas–Mustan's action thriller Machine (2017).[18] It failed at the box office.[19] She next collaborated with filmmaker Karan Johar, for their first of many films, in the Netflix anthological film Lust Stories (2018), where she starred opposite Vicky Kaushal as his sexually dissatisfied wife.[20] Her performance received mixed reactions.[21] Writing for NDTV, Raja Sen found her to be "positively lovely" in it.[22] She also featured with Shahid Kapoor in the music video "Urvashi", sung by Yo Yo Honey Singh.[23][24]

Advani expanded to Telugu cinema that year, appearing with Mahesh Babu in the action film Bharat Ane Nenu (2018) from Koratala Siva, about a student who unexpectedly becomes chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.[25][26] Janani K of India Today opined that she "shines in her brief role" but added that her character was "more of an eye-candy who doesn't add any purpose to the story".[27] Worldwide, the film earned ₹225 crore (US$28 million), making it one of Telugu cinema's highest grossers.[28][29] She, however, failed to replicate this success with her second Telugu film, Boyapati Srinu's Vinaya Vidheya Rama (co-starring Ram Charan).[30][31] In a scathing review for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo wrote, "It isn't Kiara Advani's fault that she looks lost in the melee."[32] In the same year, she was seen in a guest appearance in Abhishek Varman's ensemble period film Kalank, produced by Johar.[33]

Rise to prominence (2019–present)

Advani received wider attention later in 2019 for Sandeep Reddy Vanga's romantic drama Kabir Singh, starring Shahid Kapoor.[34] The film had a worldwide gross of over ₹378 crore (US$47 million) becoming her highest-grossing release, but critics panned it due to its depiction of misogyny and toxic masculinity.[35] Rajeev Masand bemoaned that her passive character "offers the actress little to work with".[36] She then starred in the comedy Good Newwz alongside Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Diljit Dosanjh, that revolves around two couples tryst with in vitro fertilization.[37][38] Namrata Joshi opined, "Dosanjh and Advani are all about the amplification of the boisterous, kitschy Punjabi stereotype but they play it with an infectious cheer."[39] Both Kabir Singh and Good Newwz grossed over ₹200 crores each domestically, ranking among the year's highest-grossing films.[40] She won the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Good Newwz.[41]

In 2020, Advani starred in Johar's production Guilty, a Netflix film about sexual assault.[42] Ektaa Malik of The Indian Express believed that she had been "reduced to the ‘tortured-artistic-creative’ types"[43] She then played the wife of Akshay Kumar's character in Raghava Lawrence's horror comedy Laxmii, in which Kumar's character gets possessed by a transgender ghost.[44] Instead of theatres, Laxmii was directly released on Hotstar owing to COVID-19 pandemic, and met with negative reviews.[45][46] Even so, it attained a strong viewership on the platform.[47][48] In her final release of 2020, Advani played Ghaziabad-based girl who finds love in dating apps in Indoo Ki Jawani (2020).[49]

Advani next featured in Dharma Productions's war film Shershaah (2021), based on the life of army officer Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra), in which she played the role of Batra's girlfriend. The film released digitally on Amazon Prime Video, on which it became the most-streamed Indian film.[50][51] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost opined that Advani "sparkles" in her brief role.[52] The following year, she appeared with Kartik Aaryan and Tabu in the horror comedy Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express wrote that she "has little to do except pop up now and then".[53] The film emerged as one of her most commercially successful, with worldwide earnings of over ₹2.6 billion (US$33 million).[54][55] In her second release of 2022, Advani starred alongside an ensemble cast in Jugjugg Jeeyo, a comedy-drama about divorce, in which Varun Dhawan and her played an unhappily married couple. Writing for Hindustan Times, Monika Rawal Kukreja commended her "restrained performance" in it.[56]

Advani will next star in the romantic comedy Govinda Naam Mera with Vicky Kaushal,[57] and in an untitled Telugu film directed by S. Shankar, co-starring Ram Charan.[58] Advani will reunite with Kartik Aaryan in Satyaprem Ki Katha.[59]</p>
